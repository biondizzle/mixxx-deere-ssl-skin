# Mixxx Deere SSL Remix Skin

## Why am I doing this?
  - Serato sunset their Scratch Live software for some licensed bloatware "Serato Pro"
  - I love my SL1 and SL2 boxes and the drivers keep getting further and further away from working propperly on newer Windows and Mac Operating Systems but works fine on Linux
  - I have a very expensive Rane Sixty Four mixer where the drivers no longer work on newer Windows and Mac Operating Systems but works fine on Linux
  - I hate that Scratch Live no longer works on newer Windows and Mac Operating Systems
  - I have a Pioneer controller that is locked to Rekordbox software which we'll call "clunky" to put it lightly
  - Mixxx is incredible OSS available for all Operating Systems and allows me to use whatever hardware I please
  - I am a simple DJ that doesn't need alot of bells and whistles. Give me a large library with two decks and I'm golden.
  - I've been using Scratch Live since 2005 with vertical wave formats
  - There are no Vertical Wave Format skins although Mixxx supports vertical waves

Right now this is VERY much a protoype, I'm just working my way around the Deere skin and figuring out what I can. I'm not a very good GUI programmer and haven't used Qt very much, so I'm just learning what I can while digging around. I'll probably end up removing all Deere Specific items and rename this repo so I don't stop on toes.
